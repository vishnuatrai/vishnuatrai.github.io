Nowadays blogs I am reading are mostly running with jekyll and using octopress to publish. Lot of my friends migrated from WordPress to Octopress. I was curious why they are doing so and what is the advantege with Octopress over WordPress.<!--more--> As an experiment I started developing a gihub pages application using Octopress and I found it very simple and easy to write. Good fit for my blog application.

### Why I like?
  1) Free github/heroku hosting and easy deploy  

  2) No database required( even for comments )

  3) Easy to intigrate and restore comments with disqus( till it is free )

  4) Don't need to move from your terminal to publish a blog

  5) Skill required - git, markdown, vim/emacs( any text editor ) 
  
  6) Lightweight and Fast running
  
  7) Lots of themes available

  8) etc etc etc ( still exploring )
