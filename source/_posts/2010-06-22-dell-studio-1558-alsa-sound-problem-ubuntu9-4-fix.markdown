I had the problem and the Laptop, Dell Studio 1558:
just exec as root: "nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf

and add this line:

options snd-hda-intel model=dell-m6 <!--more-->

it works for me. modeprobe.conf files are empty.
if modprob.conf files are not empty then add this line to
options snd-hda-intel model=dell-m6

it will work
