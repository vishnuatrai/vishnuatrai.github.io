I'm Vishnu Sharma and I am a software developer who specializes in building web applications in various domains(ie. Financial, Online tutorial, HR solution, ERP, Social Networking etc). I have been in the field for nearly 8.5 years, and have been loving every minute of it. I am a blogger, designer and developer. 

I am using Ruby on Rails framework to develop web apps, earlier I was using CoreJava and JSP for web development. I use python, node.js frameworks also to develop web apps. I love open source technologies, frameworks, libraries etc.

I actively contribute to ruby libraries in my spare time. I have done few contribution to Ruby on Rails framework itself. http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/vishnu-atrai/commits
