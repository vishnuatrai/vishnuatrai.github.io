I'm Vishnu Sharma and I am a software developer who specializes in building web applications in various domains(ie. Financial, Online tutorial, HR solution, ERP, Social Networking etc). I have 14+ years working experience, and I am loving every minute of it. I am a blogger, software designer and developer.

I use Java, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, Express.js, React.js for miroservices and web app development. I'm passionate about Open source technologies, frameworks, libraries and use those in my day to day work.

I actively contribute to ruby, java, node.js libraries in my spare time. I have contributed to Ruby on Rails framework itself. http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/vishnu-atrai/commits
