I'm Vishnu Sharma and I am a software developer who specializes in building web applications in various domains(ie. Financial, Online tutorial, HR solution, ERP, Social Networking etc). I have 14+ years working experience, and I am loving every minute of it. I am a blogger, designer and developer. 

I use Java, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, express.js react.js to develop web and miroservice apps. Open source technologies, frameworks, libraries excite me to explore and use in my day to day work.

I actively contribute to ruby, java, node.js libraries in my spare time. I have done few contribution to Ruby on Rails framework itself. http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/vishnu-atrai/commits
